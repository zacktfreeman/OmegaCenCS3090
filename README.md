This repo is to be used for CS 3090 - Ethics in Computing. It will contain no source code, only a README and a license. Although, the descriptions below will treat this repo as if it does contain source code.

This repository contains code for detecting stellar mass black holes through microlensing methods. The code is tailored for data from the globular cluster Omega Centauri (Omega Cen) -- the largest globular cluster in our galaxy. This project is funded by NASA Hubble, and as such, the source data is publicly available.

Omega Cen is the most massive globular cluster in our galaxy, therefore making it a good candidate for hosting potential stellar mass black holes. Previous studies have shown a need for a dark mass in Omega Cen, although there is debate upon whether this dark mass is a population of stellar mass black holes or an Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH). Recent studies (Haberle et al. 2024a) have shown evidence of an IMBH, but do not exclude significant mass contributions from stellar mass black holes. 

To find these stellar mass black holes, we can search for signatures of microlensing. Microlensing occurs when a stellar object lines up between us, the observer, and another stellar object, known as the source. The stellar object that lines up between the observer and the source is known as the lens. If there is sufficient alignment, the source star will appear to brighten for a certain amount of time. Therefore, by searching for an increase in brightness of a source star in Omega Cen, we can hope to detect a stellar mass black hole lens.
